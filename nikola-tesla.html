<H2><u>Introduction</u></H2>
<p>Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, best known for his development of alternating current electrical systems. He also made extraordinary contributions to the fields of electromagnetism and wireless radio communications. He was a child prodigy and possessed an eidetic memory with a futuristic vision for the mankind which is evident from most of his discoveries and researches. He was a trained electrical and mechanical engineer whose discoveries and inventions included the modern electric motor, wireless transmission of energy, basic laser and radar technology, the first neon and fluorescent illumination and the Tesla coil (widely used in radio, television sets, and other electronic equipment)</p>

<P id="brown">He was born on July 10, 1856 in the village of Smiljan, Austrian Empire, to Milutin Tesla, an orthodox priest and his wife, Djuka Mandic, an inventive homemaker who, in her spare time, created household appliances.He was the fourth of five children in his family. He had an eidetic memory with a knack for electrical inventions. He always credited his mother’s genetic influence for his creative abilities. He received his early education of German, arithmetic, and religion from the primary school in Smiljan.In 1870, he was enrolled at the Higher Real Gymnasium in Karlovac and graduated the four year course within three years in 1873 with the help of his extraordinary intelligence In 1875, he attended the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria, on a Military Frontier scholarship. He was a brilliant student in his first year but got addicted to gambling in his second year at the college which ruined his graduation and he was not able to obtain a degree.</P>

<LI><H3><b>Alternating current</b></H3>
    <p> It all began in 1893 at the World’s Expo in Chicago where the feud between Edison's direct current and Tesla's alternating current culminated. The direct current, which was invented by Thomas Edison, was very dangerous and costly over long distances. Tesla sought to implement alternating current for the power grid because it was cheaper and safer. To prove the safety of AC, he reportedly used a Tesla coil to send electricity through himself to produce light. Despite Edison's and General Electric's efforts to implement direct current, Tesla won the battle of the currents.

<LI><H3><b>First hydro-electric power plant</b></H3>
    <p>
	Nikola Tesla along with George Westinghouse constructed the world's first hydro-electric power plant at the base of Niagra Falls. The power plant remains to this day as a museum, but it was one of the first energy generation locations that started the process of electrifying the world.

<LI><H3><b>X-rays</b></H3>
    <p>
	At the time of Tesla's life, ionizing radiation and electromagnetism were heavily studied subjects. His early experiments with x-ray imaging eventually led to its implementation in the medical field. The discovery of x-rays was one that Tesla found through his quest to understand the unseen forces in the world around him. This drive ultimately is what made Tesla such a profoundly amazing inventor.
